                            Difference between SQL and NoSQL
                        </h2>

                            SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
                            databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
                            tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
                            that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.SQL databases
                            are efficient at processing queries and joining data across tables,
                            making it easier to perform complex queries against structured data,
                            including ad hoc requests. NoSQL databases lack consistency across
                            products and typically require more work to query data, particular
                            as query complexity increases.

                            What is JWT (JSON Web Token)? JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open
                            standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between
                            parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally signed
                            using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity
                            Provider(IdP).Information Exchange: JWTs are a good way of securely
                            transmitting information between parties because they can be signed,
                            which means you can be sure that the senders are who they say they
                            are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that
                            the content hasn't been tampered with.

                            JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
                            any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on
                            the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
                            JavaScript programming language.Javascript is used in frontend
                            development. Nodejs is used in server-side development.Javascript is
                            capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM. Nodejs does not
                            have capability to add HTML tags.Javascript can only be run in the
                            browsers. We can run Javascript outside the browser with the help of
                            NodeJS.

                        <p className="text-justify">
                            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
                            EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
                            architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
                            that receives requests and processes them.They handle 40K requests
                            per second having Node. Multiple clients make multiple requests to
                            the NodeJS server. NodeJS receives these requests and places them
                            into the EventQueue . NodeJS server has an internal component
                            referred to as the EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives
                            requests and processes them. This EventLoop is single threaded.
